A shoulder injury and subsequent surgery took me off the bike this summer. With a suddenly open schedule a friend got me back into fishing, specifically the Tenkara method of fly fishing. We started with catching bluegills in the local park. It was fine, but we had a bigger goal, one we still haven't achieved - native trout.

As we worked our way toward this goal aquiring flies, gadgets, and gizmos, it became apparent we would need to step into the literal deep end with a pair of waders. Fishing from the water provides access to those hard-to-reach pockets and there's less chance to snag tree limbs. There is also the joyful feeling of being one with the fish.

I was not looking forward to the hunt for waders in a tall size. A lengthy inseam is imperitative since fishers are frequently kneeling, bending over, and overall putting their legs in unusual orientations. The boot or stockingfoot means pants cannot ride up and mobility will be very limited if the inseam is even slightly too short.

## Researching

The default advice is to get custom sized waders, but they're a big investment and we are only getting started. Those that do offer standard tall sizes are mostly premium brands with premium prices. The other common issue with tall clothing is they are big **and** tall. Waders are oversized in the hips and chest already so I was concerned with having excess fabric in the way.

My basic criteria was:
* Price - $300 maximum
* Length - 36" insteam minimum
* Stockingfoot size - Size 14 minimum

The [Simms Tributary waders](https://www.simmsfishing.com/products/ms-tributary-stockingfoot) only go up to a size 11 shoe and [High 'n Dry](https://www.hndoutdoors.com/) have quite a large chest size in the long length.

The [Orvis Clearwater Waders](https://www.orvis.com/product/mens-clearwater-waders/2TZX.html) were the only waders I found that met all of my criteria. The Large XLong was the only size that worked for me because I wear a size 15 (50 EU) shoe. Any smaller in the chest came with a smaller bootie size.

After deciding on the Orvis waders the problem I faced is that the tall sizes are out of stock just about everywhere. I used [a Google Shopping search](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=orvis%20clearwater%20waders%20%22X%20Long%22%20under%20%24300) to find third-party stores selling the tall size. Most were out of stock but [WorldCast Anglers](https://worldcastanglers.com/store/Orvis-Clearwater-Waders-Stockingfoot-Mens-p604519545) had two pairs in stock. I picked up both pairs for my buddy and I and they arrived in less than a week.


## First Impressions

</p>

There are mixed reviews on the durability of entry-level waders, but the material feels weighty and good quality. I would be disappointed if my $250 waders had fabric that felt cheap. The chest and hips are a bit loose, but the included belt keeps excess fabric in check and keeps it out of the way while fishing. A light jacket underneath also helps fill out the chest.

My biggest fear was the stockingfoot being too small. Orvis advertises fitting a size 12-14. I've purchased watershoes and neoprene socks advertising the same sizing so I hoped my size 15 feet could squeeze in. In reality the stockingfoot was plenty large and doesn't feel stretched at all.

The 36" inseam is a touch too short for my body. I feel the material max out when taking a step forward or bending over. It's manageable for infrquent use though and I don't notice it as much while wading. I unclipped the lace hooks while hiking to allow more flex.

## Conclusions

Compromises are often necessary when shopping for tall outdoor clothing. These waders were a surprising case where all of my requirements were met. While expensive for one of my second-priority hobbies, I recognize durability and a good fit is important. The fit is about as good as I could ask for with a price that doesn't make me cry.
